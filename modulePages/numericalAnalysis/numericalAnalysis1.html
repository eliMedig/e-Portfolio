												<li>Filtering the dataset using subset() to include only individuals aged 75+ and who were a victim of crime.</li>
												<li>Saving the filtered dataset as crime_75victim for further analysis.</li>
												<li>Counting the total number of individuals in the subset to document the sample size.</li>
											</ol>
											<h3>Results</h3>
													<p><strong>Step 1: Inspecting the field agegrp7</strong></p>
													<p>To confirm the value representing respondents aged 75+, the labels for the agegrp7 field were checked using: 
														<br><code>attributes(csew1314teachingopen$agegrp7)</code></p>
													<p>The results showed that the value 7 corresponds to the age group "75+".</p>
													
													<p><strong>Step 2: Creating the Subset</strong></p>
													<p>A subset of individuals aged 75+ who were also victims of crime was created using the following command: 
														<br> <code>crime_75victim <- subset(csew1314teachingopen, agegrp7 == "7" & bcsvictim == "Victim of crime")</code></p>		

													<p><strong>Step 3: Exporting the Subset</strong></p>
													<p>The subset was exported to a CSV file for further use with the command: 
														<br> <code>write.csv(crime_75victim, "crime_75victim.csv", row.names = FALSE)</code></p>

													<p><strong>Step 4: Verifying the Subset</strong></p>
													<p>To verify the results, the number of rows in the subset was counted using: 
														<br> <code>nrow(crime_75victim)</code></p>
													<p> This confirmed that the subset contains 67 individuals.</p>

								<div class="week">
									<div class="week-header">Week 5: Activities</div>
										<div class="week-content">
											<h3>Activity</h3>
											<p>The data activities of week 5 aimed at introducing visaluzation:</p>
											<ol>
												<li>Creating a boxplot with boxplot and ggplot2 to assess levels of anti-social behaviour in neighbourhoods.</li>
												<li>Creating a barplot to show how how many samples fall into which category. </li>
												<li>Starting the first stastisics discussion in the course module.</li>
											</ol>
											<h3>Results</h3>
												<p><strong>Step 1: Boxplot of Anti-Social Behaviour Levels</strong></p>
												<p>The first task was to create a boxplot for the variable antisocx, which assesses the level of anti-social behaviour that survey respondents experienced in their neighbourhood. Using the boxplot() function in R (with base graphics), the plot was created with the title "Levels of anti-social behaviour in neighbourhood 'antisocx'", and the boxplot was coloured purple with outliers in blue.</p>
													<code>boxplot(csew1314teachingopen$antisocx,</code><br>
													<code>main = "Levels of anti-social behaviour in neighbourhood 'antisocx'",</code><br> 
													<code>col = "purple",</code><br> 
													<code>outcol = "blue")</code><br>
												<br>	
												<p>The boxplot() visualized the distribution of anti-social behaviour levels among respondents, with the outliers distinctly marked in blue.</p>
												<img src="../../images/boxplot.jpg" alt="Boxplot of Crime Victimization" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-top: 10px;">


												<p><strong>Step 2: Boxplot of Anti-Social Behaviour Using ggplot2</strong></p>
												<p>As an alternative, a boxplot was also created using ggplot2 for a more aesthetic and customizable plot. This version featured yellow for the boxplot fill and red for the outliers.</p>
													<code>ggplot(csew1314teachingopen, aes(x = "", y = antisocx)) + </code><br>
													<code>geom_boxplot(fill = "yellow", outlier.colour = "red") + </code><br>
												  <code>labs(title = "Levels of anti-social behaviour in neighbourhood 'antisocx')") + </code><br>
												  <code>theme_minimal() </code><br>
												<br>
												<p>The ggplot2 version provided a visually appealing alternative, enhancing readability through custom colors and a minimalistic theme.</p>
												<img src="../../images/ggplot2.jpg" alt="GGPlot Plot of Crime Victimization" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-top: 10px;">

												<p><strong>Step 3: Bar Plot of Crime Victimization</strong></p>
												<p>The second task was to create a bar plot to assess whether survey respondents experienced crime in the 12 months prior to the survey using the bcsvictim variable. A frequency table was first created, and then a bar plot was generated using the barplot() function with orange bars, which visually displayed the number of respondents who were victims of crime versus those who were not.</p>
													<code>barplot(crime_counts, </code><br>
													<code>main = "Survey Respondents - Victims of Crime", </code><br>
													<code>col = "orange", </code><br>
													<code>xlab = "Crime Experience", </code><br>
													<code>ylab = "Number of Respondents")</code><br>
												<br>
												<p>This bar plot illustrated the distribution of crime victimization among the respondents, highlighting the number of individuals who experienced crime in the past 12 months:</p>
												<img src="../../images/barplot.jpg" alt="Bar Plot of Crime Victimization" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-top: 10px;">


												<p><strong>First Group Discussion</strong></p>
												<p>The first group discussion was about streamlining data visualization by optimizing an existing table of a report.</p>
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Challenges:</strong> The table was dense, mixing numbers and percentages, with discrepancies in respondent counts (490–547).</li>
													<li><strong>Actions Taken:</strong> Separated data into clearer columns, added total respondents, and used ChatGPT to generate Python code for visualization.</li>
													<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> A cleaner table and a dynamic visualization using matplotlib.</li>

									<div class="week-header">Week 7: Activities</div>
										<div class="week-content">
											<h3>Activity</h3>
											<p>Week 7 consisted of several data activites based on a health information dataset:</p>
											<ol>
												<li>Find out mean, median and mode of variables sbp, dbp and income.</li>
												<li>Find out the five-figure summary of income variable and present it using a Boxplot.</li>
												<li>Run a suitable hypothesis test to see if there is any association between systolic blood pressure and presence and absence of peptic ulcer.</li>
												<li>Final summary of discussion with other students.</li>
											</ol>
											<h3>Results</h3>

											
													<p><strong>Step 1: getting mean, median and modestrong</strong></p4>
													<p>To get the median and mode of each of those variable we can use the following commands in R: </p>
		
													<strong>The means for each:</strong><br>
													<code>mean_sbp <- mean(Health_Data$sbp, na.rm = TRUE)</code><br>
													<code>mean_dbp <- mean(Health_Data$dbp, na.rm = TRUE)</code><br>
													<code>mean_income <- mean(Health_Data$income, na.rm = TRUE)</code><br>
													<br>
													<strong>The median for each:</strong><br>
													<code>median_sbp <- median(Health_Data$sbp, na.rm = TRUE)</code><br>
													<code>median_dbp <- median(Health_Data$dbp, na.rm = TRUE)</code><br>
													<code>median_income <- median(Health_Data$income, na.rm = TRUE)</code><br>
													<br>
													<strong>The mode for each:</strong><br>
													<code>mode_sbp <- getmode(Health_Data$sbp)</code><br>
													<code>mode_dbp <- getmode(Health_Data$dbp)</code><br>
													<code>mode_income <- getmode(Health_Data$income)</code><br>								


													<p><strong>Step 2: Create a boxplot for the income variable</strong></p>
													<p>To create a boxplot for the variable income we can use the boxplot command: </p>
													<code>boxplot(Health_Data$income, main = "Boxplot of Income", ylab = "Income", col = "lightblue")</code>
													<br>
													<br>
													<p>This results in a boxplot that shows the income distribution:</p>
													<img src="../../images/incomeboxplot.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-top: 10px;">

													<p><strong>Step 3: Run a hypothesis test to see if there is any association between systolic blood pressure and presence and absence of peptic ulcer.</strong></p>
													<p>To compare the means of two groups and check if there is any statistically relevant correlation we can use the T-Test:</p>
													<code>t_test_result <- t.test(sbp ~ pepticulcer, data = Health_Data)</code>
													<br>
													<br>
													<p>This results can be shown by simply typing t_test_result. They indicate that there is no significant evidence for the hypothesis that peptic ulcer is associated with systolic blood pressure:</p>

									<div class="week-header">Week 8: Activities</div>
										<div class="week-content">
											<h3>Activities</h3>
											<p>Following data activities were part of week 8:</p>
											<ol>
												<li>Find out the mean, median and mode of age variable.</li>
												<li>Find out whether median diastolic blood pressure is same among diabetic and non-diabetic participants.</li>
												<li>Find out whether systolic BP is different across occupational groups.</li>
												<li>Additional: Scenario-Based Exercise 95% Confidence Interval.</li>
											</ol>
											<h3>Results</h3>

												<p><strong>Step 1: Get statistical information about a variable</strong></p>
												The mode, mean and median:<br>
													<code>mean_age <- mean(Health_Data$age, na.rm = TRUE)</code><br>
													<code>median_age <- median(Health_Data$age, na.rm = TRUE)</code><br>
													<code>mode_age <- as.numeric(names(sort(table(Health_Data$age), decreasing = TRUE))[1])</code><br>
												<br>
												<p>As a result the following values have been found:</p>
												<img src="../../images/result_8_1.jpg" alt="Result" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-top: 10px;">


												<p><strong>Step 2: Diastolic blood pressure check</strong></p>
												<p>The second step was to 1. split the data into diabetic and non-diabetic while 2. also taking the dbp value for each. This can then be used to perfom a Mann-Withney U test to compare the median dbp between the diabetic and non-diabetic entries.</p>
												Split into a diabetic and non-diabetic list while keeping the dbp for each:<br>
												<code>diabetic_group <- Health_Data$dbp[Health_Data$diabetes == 1]</code><br>
												<code>non_diabetic_group <- Health_Data$dbp[Health_Data$diabetes == 2]</code><br>
												<br>
												Performing the Mann-Withney U test:<br>
												<code>result <- wilcox.test(diabetic_group, non_diabetic_group, exact = FALSE)</code>
												<br>
												<br>
												<p>Result was a p value of 0.7999 which means that the hypothesis was strongly rejected being much greater than the 0.05 treshhold usually taken to validate.</p>
												<img src="../../images/result_8_2.jpg" alt="Result" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-top: 10px;">


												<p><strong>Step 3: Systolic BP check</strong></p>
												<p>The third step was to check the systolic BP for being different across occupationl groups.</p>
												First we run a shapiro test to understand the normality for each occupation group:<br>
												<code>shapiro_results <- by(Health_Data$sbp, Health_Data$occupation, shapiro.test)</code><br> 
												<br>
												The p-values for all 4 occupational groups was below 0.05 which means we can reject the null hypothesis indicating that the data is not normally distributed. We will use the Kruskal-Wallis test to check the data as it does not require normality. The result should tell us wherte there is a significant differenct in systolic blood pressure across the occupational groups:<br>
												<code>kruskal_result <- kruskal.test(sbp ~ occupation, data = Health_Data)</code><br> 
												<br>
												<p>The kruskal test resulted in a p value of 0.8545 which means we can reject the null hypothesis and the occupations do not have a significant difference in blood pressure distribution. The following image shows how the systolic blood pressure is distributed among the four occupation categories:</p>
												<img src="../../images/result_8_3.jpg" alt="Result" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-top: 10px;">


												<p><strong>Step 4: Getting through the scenario based solution</strong></p>
												<p>We will import the data to R where there will be an aray for each of the three vendors:</p>
													<code>vendor1 <- c(45, 29, 56, 52, 45, 45, 41)</code><br>
													<code>vendor2 <- c(61, 53, 41, 58, 53, 47, 44)</code><br>
													<code>vendor3 <- c(35, 21, 33, 27, 22, 26, 30)</code><br>
												<p>We will now take the mean of each vendor to understand which has the highest mean:</p>
													<code>mean_vendor1 <- mean(vendor1)</code><br>
													<code>mean_vendor2 <- mean(vendor2)</code><br>
													<code>mean_vendor3 <- mean(vendor3)</code><br>
												<p>As a result vendor 2 has the highest mean which could indicate this as the best vendor for the training.</p>

											<ol>
												<li>Find out correlation between systolic and diastolic BP.</li>
												<li>Produce a scatter plot between systolic and diastolic BP.</li>
											</ol>
											<h3>Results</h3>

											<p><strong>Step 1: Finding the correlation between systolic and diastolic blood pressure</strong></p>

											<h3>Activities</h3>
											<p>The data activities during this week focused on working with regression:</p>
											<ol>
												<li>Perform simple linear regression analysis to find the population regression equation to predict the diastolic BP by systolic BP.</li>
												<li>Interpret the findings of regression analysis at 5% level of significance.</li>
											</ol>
											<h3>Results</h3>
											
											<p><strong>Step 1: Fit the linear regression model</strong></p>
												<p>We use the lm() function in R to fit the model:</p>
													<code>model <- lm(dbp ~ sbp, data = Health_Data)</code><br>
												<br>
												<p>The linear regression model to predict diastolic blood pressure (DBP) based on systolic blood pressure (SBP) is DBP=19.41+0.496⋅SBP. The following can be interpreted from the results:</p>
													<ol>
														<li>19.41 is the intercept: The predicted diastolic blood pressure when systolic blood pressure is 0 (not practically meaningful but part of the equation).</li>
														<li>0.496is the slope: For every unit increase in SBP, DBP is expected to increase by 0.496 units on average.</li>
														<li>The p value is smaller than 0.05 this means the relationship between sbp and dbp is highly statistically significant at the 5% level of significance.</li>
														<li>The multiple R square of 0.7171 indicates that 71.71% of the variability in dbp is explained by sbp.</li>
														<li>The adjusted R square of 0.7157 is very close to the multiple R square which indicates that the model is well fit.</li>
														<li>The residual standard error (RSE) is 6.264 which represents the typical deviation of observed DBP values from the predicted values.</li>
													</ol>
												<p>The regression analysis shows a strong and statistically significant positive relationship between SBP and DBP:</p>
