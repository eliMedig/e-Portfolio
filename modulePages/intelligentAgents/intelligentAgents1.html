											<h2>Theory</h2>
											<p><strong>Trends in Computing</strong></p>
											<p>We started this module by exploring five major trends in modern computing:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Ubiquity: Smart technologies have become increasingly affordable and prevalent, leading to widespread adoption in everyday devices—from IoT applications to voice assistants like Alexa and Siri.</li>
												<li>Interconnection: The digital world is more connected than ever, driven by the proliferation of the internet, mobile computing, and 5G networks, with over 14.4 billion devices now connected globally.</li>
												<li>Intelligence: The complexity of tasks we can automate continues to increase. Machines now handle operations that were previously unimaginable, thanks to hardware advances and sophisticated algorithms.</li>
												<li>Delegation: We increasingly delegate tasks—sometimes even safety-critical ones like aircraft control—to automated systems, trusting them over human operators in many scenarios.</li>
												<li>Human-Orientation: Interaction models have shifted from machine-centric interfaces (e.g., punch cards) to more intuitive methods like touch and voice, improving accessibility and user experience.</li>
											</ul>

											<p><strong>Introduction to Agents</strong></p>
											<p>We also examined the concept of an agent in general: a system capable of taking independent actions to meet objectives within its defined environment.</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Agents perceive their environment using sensors and act through effectors.</li>
												<li>They operate with varying degrees of autonomy from passive services (like APIs) to semi-autonomous and fully autonomous systems.</li>
												<li>Agent actions often have preconditions. For instance, the action “pick up cat” only makes sense if a cat is present and willing, and if the agent can lift it.</li>
											</ul>

											<h2>Contributions & Artefacts</h2>
											<p><strong>First weekly discussion - Initial Post</strong></p>
											<p>Growing system complexity, distributed environments and the limitations of traditional centralized architectures are just some of the reasons for the rise of agent-based systems. Today digital ecosystem has become ever more interconnected and unpredictable which increased the need for autonomous and adaptive systems. Agent-based computing emerged to address these challenges by offering systems that can operate independently. They interact with one another and take decisions by themselves (Russel and Norvig, 2021).</p>
											<p>Scalability, modularity and robustness are just some of the factors that motivate companies to introduce agent-based systems. In sharp contrast to traditional procedural or object-oriented systems, agents can represent goal-oriented entities that work decentralized and are capable of negotiation, cooperation, as well as conflict resolution by themselves. Agent-based systems are especially valuable in dynamic fields like supply chain management, logistic and coordination, financial markets and smart power grids. All those examples share complex environments that can be supported by system taking over decisions for stakeholders or simply simulate real-world complexity of the environment for improving processes and procedures.</p>
											<p>There are various agent models in use today. On one side there are reactive agents that respond to environmental inputs without internal models and on the other hand there are deliberative agents that use symbolic reasoning and planning. Hybrid models combine both approaches for flexibility and responsiveness (Jennings and Wooldridge, 1998). Learning agents, often supported by reinforcement learning or evolutionary algorithms, further extend this paradigm by adapting over time to improve performance.</p>
											<p>In summary, agent-based systems reflect a shift from traditional automation toward decentralised, intelligent coordination.</p>
