											<h2>Theory</h2>
												<p><strong>Research Methods, Scientific Thinking, and Ethics in Computing</strong></p>
													<p>This week introduced the foundations of research methods and the ethical principles that underpin both academic inquiry and professional computing practice. The focus was on understanding the purpose of research, the scientific method, and the ethical and professional standards guiding responsible research.</p>


											<h2>Contributions & Artefacts</h2>
												<p><strong>Weekly Discussion 1 - Initial Post</strong></p>
													<p>The Accessibility in Software Development case demonstrates how neglecting professional ethics can result in social exclusion and reputational harm. AllTogether’s decision to release an inaccessible software version, despite awareness of its flaws, conflicts with several of the principles of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Code of Ethics (ACM, 2025). </p>
													<p>Taking a closer look at the principles, we can identify that it violates principle 1.1, which requires computing professionals to contribute to society and human well-being. Additionally, there is a conflict with principle 1.4, which calls on professionals to be fair and act not to discriminate. </p>
													<p>By excluding users with disabilities from effectively using the tool, the company failed to uphold its ethical duty to promote equitable access to technology. In this way they have discriminated against a group and not contributed to society and human well-being.</p>
													<p>Comparatively, the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct also stresses inclusion, integrity, and responsibility. Therefore again, this case clearly breaches the BCS Public Interest principle, which requires members to have due regard for the wellbeing of others and to promote equal access to the benefits of IT (BCS, 2025). </p>
													<p>Furthermore, by prioritising commercial deadlines over compliance and accessibility, the company failed to demonstrate professional competence and integrity. Both would demand that computing professionals act within their competence and comply with relevant legislation and standards.</p>

												<h2><strong>Choosing the topic for your literature review and presentation</strong></h2>
												<p>Because the topic can not be used for my Master Thesis / Master Project I decided to go with a topic which has little to no intersection with the areas I am thining of chosing for my Masters Thesis / Project.</p>
												<ul>
													<li>5.	What is the gender pay gap in the technology sector in the country of your choice?</li>

											<h2>Contributions & Artefacts</h2>
												<p><strong>Weekly Discussion 1 - Peer Reponse 1</strong></p>
													<p>Thank you for your insightful post. You’ve presented an insightful analysis of the Blocker Plus case and effectively connected it to both the BCS Code of Conduct and wider AI governance principles. I especially agree with your interpretation that the failure to prevent bias and data poisoning represents a breach of the duty to act in the public interest (BCS, 2021). What really stands out to me is the tension between technical reliability and moral accountability. Once the model was compromised, the developers’ decision to preserve it prioritised operational continuity over social responsibility which was a choice that undermines public trust in AI systems.</p>
													<p>Your link to Kluge Corrêa et al. (2023) is crucial because they highlight, voluntary ethical frameworks alone cannot ensure compliance. Which I also agree with. This case underscores the need for mandatory auditing and explainability provisions, such as those being institutionalised in the EU AI Act (European Commission, 2023). Embedding periodic bias audits and red-team testing could have mitigated the manipulation you describe.</p>
													<p>I wonder how you view the role of external oversight. Do you think professional bodies like the BCS should be empowered to sanction such ethical violations, or should this fall to independent AI regulators? That distinction seems central to bridging the current gap between professional ethics and enforceable accountability.</p>

												<p><strong>Weekly Discussion 1 - Peer Response 2</strong></p>
													<p>You have provided a thoughtful and balanced interpretation of the Corazón case, particularly in recognising that ethical computing in healthcare extends beyond regulatory compliance. I agree with your observation that the company’s transparency and collaboration with external researchers demonstrate ethical maturity which is a principle directly aligned with the ACM Code of Ethics’ duty to avoid harm and maintain honesty in system reporting (ACM, 2018).</p>
													<p>Your discussion raises an important tension between innovation and safety. As Camara, Peris-Lopez and Tapiador (2015) said, the same wireless connectivity that enables life-saving interventions also provides the attack surface for malicious exploitation. This duality makes proactive ethics essential. We must always aim at embedding ethics by design which can be achieved by incorporating security and privacy risk assessments throughout the product lifecycle (Floridi and Cowls, 2022).</p>
													<p>One question your post implies is how far liability should extend when independent researchers uncover vulnerabilities. Should the responsibility remain solely with the manufacturer itself, or does the research community share a duty to disclose and mitigate risks responsibly? I think they would have to. What are your thoughts?</p>

															<tr>
															<th style="width: 35%; background-color: #f0f0f0;">Question</th>
															<th style="background-color: #f9f9f9;">Answer (Topic: Gender Pay Gap in the Technology Sector in Switzerland)</th>
															</tr>
														</thead>
														<tbody>
															<tr>
															<td><strong>What is the focus and aim of your review? Who is your audience?</strong></td>
															<td>The review examines the persistence, causes, and implications of the gender pay gap within Switzerland’s technology sector. It aims to identify structural, cultural, and policy-related factors contributing to wage disparities. The intended audience includes academics, policymakers, HR professionals, and diversity advocates in the Swiss tech industry.</td>
															</tr>
															<tr>
															<td><strong>Why is there a need for your review? Why is it significant?</strong></td>
															<td>Despite Switzerland’s reputation for innovation and equality, data from the Federal Statistical Office (BFS, 2023) show a persistent pay gap in tech roles. The topic is significant because it intersects with issues of gender equity, economic competitiveness, and talent retention in a key national industry.</td>
															</tr>
															<tr>
															<td><strong>What is the context of the topic or issue? What perspective do you take? What framework do you use to synthesise the literature?</strong></td>
															<td>The review situates the issue within broader discussions on gender bias, labour market segmentation, and workplace culture in STEM fields. It adopts a socio-economic and organizational behaviour perspective, synthesizing literature using the <em>Gender Inequality Framework</em> and <em>Human Capital Theory</em> to connect structural and individual determinants.</td>
															</tr>
															<tr>
															<td><strong>How did you locate and select sources for inclusion in the review?</strong></td>
															<td>Academic databases such as Google Scholar, JSTOR, and the University of Essex Online Library were searched using keywords like “gender pay gap Switzerland,” “tech industry inequality,” and “STEM wage disparity.” Inclusion criteria focused on empirical studies, official reports (e.g., BFS, OECD), and publications from the last 10 years.</td>
															</tr>
															<tr>
															<td><strong>How is your review structured?</strong></td>
															<td>The review begins with an overview of the gender pay gap in Switzerland, followed by an analysis of sector-specific trends in technology. It then examines causes (education, experience, bias, work culture), evaluates policy and organizational interventions, and concludes with research gaps and recommendations.</td>
															</tr>
															<tr>
															<td><strong>What are the main findings in the literature on this topic?</strong></td>
															<td>Studies consistently show that women in Swiss tech earn 10–20% less than men with similar qualifications (OECD, 2023). Contributing factors include underrepresentation in leadership roles, part-time work patterns, negotiation differences, and unconscious bias in promotion and pay-setting processes.</td>
															</tr>
															<tr>
															<td><strong>What are the main strengths and limitations of this literature?</strong></td>
															<td>Strengths include the availability of quantitative wage data and detailed occupational analyses. Limitations include a lack of longitudinal studies, limited qualitative insights on workplace culture, and few cross-industry comparisons isolating technology from general STEM fields.</td>
															</tr>
															<tr>
															<td><strong>Are there any discrepancies in this literature?</strong></td>
															<td>Yes. While some authors attribute the pay gap primarily to structural bias and gendered socialization, others argue that career interruptions and self-selection explain most of the variance. There is also inconsistency in how bonuses and stock-based compensation are measured.</td>
															</tr>
															<tr>
															<td><strong>What conclusions do you draw from the review? What do you argue needs to be done as an outcome of the review?</strong></td>
															<td>The review concludes that the Swiss tech sector’s gender pay gap reflects systemic and cultural factors rather than mere individual choice. It calls for transparent salary reporting, gender-neutral recruitment, targeted mentoring programmes, and stronger enforcement of equal pay legislation to promote fairness and competitiveness.</td>
															</tr>

											<h2>Contributions & Artefacts</h2>
												<p><strong>Weekly Discussion 1 - Summary Post</strong></p>
													<p>The first discussion forum highlighted how professional ethics in computing must evolve from static codes into dynamic frameworks to ensure accountability. Across the Blocker Plus and Corazón case studies, a recurring theme emerged. A responsible way of innovating does not only demand technical excellence but also moral vigilance.</p>
													<p>In the Blocker Plus discussion, the manipulation of machine-learning feedback loops exposed how algorithmic bias can undermine fairness and inclusivity. Even when systems comply with formal legislation it is possible that their outcomes can still conflict with the public-interest principle. This principle is one of the many principles found in the BCS Code of Conduct (2021). This aligns with Corrêa et al. (2023), who found that most global AI-ethics guidelines remain voluntary and lack enforceable accountability. </p>
													<p>The Corazón case, on the other hand, exemplified proactive ethics through collaboration with researchers and transparent risk disclosure. Embedding an ethics by design approach during system development. This also aligns with what Floridi and Cowls (2022) said. Such an approach ensures that safety, privacy, and fairness are systematically integrated throughout the technology lifecycle rather than retrofitted after harm occurs.</p>
													<p>Together, these cases reinforced my understanding that professionalism in computing means acting as both innovator and moral steward.</p>

														<td><strong>Which of the methods described in this week’s reading would you think would suit your purpose?</strong></td>
														<td>
															A mixed methods approach would best suit this study. Quantitative analysis can assess salary data, job levels, and gender distribution using statistical tools, while qualitative research can explore underlying causes such as workplace culture, career interruptions, or negotiation behaviour. This combination supports a more holistic understanding of both measurable disparities and the social dynamics behind them.
														</td>
														</tr>
														<tr>
														<td><strong>Which data collection methods would you consider using?</strong></td>
														<td>
															Secondary data from official sources like the <em>Swiss Federal Statistical Office (BFS)</em>, <em>OECD</em>, and <em>World Economic Forum</em> would be used to analyse existing pay and employment statistics.  
															Additionally, primary qualitative data could be collected through semi-structured interviews with employees, HR managers, or policymakers in the Swiss tech sector. This would reveal perceptions of fairness, barriers to promotion, and experiences related to gender equality policies.
														</td>
														</tr>
														<tr>
														<td><strong>Which required skills will you need to have or develop for the chosen project?</strong></td>
														<td>
															The project will require several research and analytical skills:
															<ul>
															<li>Quantitative analysis skills – using Excel, Python, or SPSS to analyse salary data and identify pay gaps.</li>
															<li>Qualitative analysis skills – coding interview transcripts and identifying recurring themes using tools like NVivo.</li>
															<li>Critical evaluation skills – interpreting results within theoretical frameworks such as <em>Human Capital Theory</em> and <em>Gender Inequality Theory</em>.</li>
															<li>Ethical research practice – ensuring confidentiality and informed consent in any interviews or surveys.</li>
															<li>Academic writing and referencing – structuring arguments clearly and citing sources in Harvard style.</li>
